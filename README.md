# Woo-Additional-Terms
Woo Additional Terms allows you to add another I Agree with the terms and conditions checkbox to the WooCommerce Checkout page.

This plugin will be most helpful for e-commerce stores in EU as many countries in the union require the cancellation policy be displayed as a separate checkbox and agree by customer before placing the order.

You can optionally link an article or page that contains your additional terms and conditions. For example you may want to include a cancellation policy and ask customers to agree to it before placing the order. 

If the checkbox is not checked and the customer attempts to place order, an WooCommerce alert box will be shown that prevents them from moving forward.

Plugin setup is minimal and requires no knowledge of HTML or CSS. It could not be simpler.
